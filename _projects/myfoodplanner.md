tagline: Weekly food planning and shopping app
description: The purpose of this tool is threefold <ol><li>enable smart nutrition planning</li> <li>provide efficient organization for preparing all of our weekly meals at once on Saturday </li> <li>provide a shopping list organized by store aisle for efficient shopping.</li> </ol>Since I use this app multiple times per day, I have ample opportunity to experiment with new feature ideas and then knock them out quickly. It's great practice for failing fast and fixing fast. There is no other food app out there that does exactly what I want, so I continue to build upon this one.
