tagline: Weekly food planning and shopping app
description: "This app is a slow build of a larger plan I've been working on for a while. The purpose of this tool is threefold: 1) enable smart nutrition planning 2) provide organization for a day when we cook all meals for the week 3) provide a shopping list organized by store aisle for efficient shopping. Currently the app is about 50% complete, but it is functional and in use since January 2019 for points 2 and 3. Part of this point of this app is to practice breaking down complicated ideas and features into something achievable and deployable. It's better to fail fast and learn what the feature should be than invest a whole lot of time into an untested idea. This app is excellent practice in that arena."
