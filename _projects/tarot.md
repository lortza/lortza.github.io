description: Get an instant tarot reading -- no psychic required! It's complete with full reading explanations that are generated from the database, including both upright and inverse meanings for cards (kind of a big deal), yowza! <a href="https://modernmystic.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">It's fun! Try it out</a>. <br><br>Single purpose objects provide the solution for marrying 2 sets of data together (<code>Card</code> and <code>ReadingPosition</code>) to generate a unique <code>Reading</code> end product that tells a story. If you have a hankering for an old school CLI, you can play with the version that started it all here at <a href='https://repl.it/@lortz/tarotreadings' target='_blank'>this repl</a>.
