tagline: Build yoga workouts with prerecorded tracks
description: yogaplaylist is a personal yoga practice app that builds yoga workouts, or 'playlists', with a variable pose hold time between poses. I built this app to replace some mp3s I created several years ago and to take the opportunity to learn what was new in Rails 6. <br><br>Having a variable 'hold time' for the poses is important to me because some days, I may have a full 30 minutes, so I'll use a hold time of 30 seconds on my 'flexibility workout'. Other days (much like this past week when I had a mean cold), I may choose to do an 8 second hold. I could still get through all of the poses and I still did something good for my body that day -- whereas if I had been locked in to a 30-second hold, that would not have happened.
