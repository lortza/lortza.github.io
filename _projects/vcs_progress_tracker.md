tagline: Curriculum Velocity & Completion Date Projection
description: Much like other apps I've built, this one was inspired by my need for a specific tool to make my life easier. I was working my way through a self-paced software engineering curriculum and wanted to be able to primarily 1) track my progress and 2) estimate my completion date. I built this app and it has, indeed, solved my problem. Check out the repo README for a tour of the app.
