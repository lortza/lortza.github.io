tagline: Javascript Validations & Hand-Rolled Authentication
description: Write an apology to someone and send it via social media with the very forgivable face of Ryan Gosling. It's the app you didn't even know you needed until now. You're welcome. <br><br>It's a relatively simple, Rails app, but it's fun and it has a couple of nice features. The apology form has some nifty character counting feedback. The content and urls for social media sharing are being pulled conveniently from the existing SEO-friendly <code>content_for</code> tags. And the admin tools are facilitated by my own hand-rolled authentication.
