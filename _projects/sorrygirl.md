tagline: Restful Rails & Social Media Sharing
description: Write an apology to someone and send it via social media with the very forgivable face of Ryan Gosling. You're welcome. This is a relatively simple Rails app, but it's fun. The apology form has some nifty character counting feedback and the content and urls for social media sharing is being pulled from <code>content_for</code> tags.
