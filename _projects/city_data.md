description: With API calls for all the things! This is a combo <a href="https://github.com/lortza/react_rails_api_city_data" target="_blank" alt="react_rails_api_city_data">React app</a> + separate <a href="https://github.com/lortza/rails_api_integrator" target="_blank" alt="rails_api_integrator">Rails API app</a>. It's loaded with location-specific feeds, which are the product of 6 different APIs repackaged as one inside the Rails API. All of that makes the Rails API a pretty tidy package to serve to the React app. It's tempting to call it ETL, but there is no actual saving to a db, so instead it's just a killer API.
