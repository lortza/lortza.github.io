tagline: Data parsing, Regex, and Matching Algorithms
description: Create a profile and see deals on top outdoor apparel and gear in your size. We're pulling in data from XML datafeeds (rake tasks, nokogiri) and parsing it into our database objects (regex) then matching it to your profile's specifications (scopes & postgres queries). It's all about the datafeed parsing, baby!
