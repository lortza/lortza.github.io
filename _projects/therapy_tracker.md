tagline: Tracks Pain & Progress for PT
description: One of the challenges of reporting pain back to a physical therapist is getting accurate data on how often and how severe pain is. Replacing the anecdotal version of pain with a data version gives everybody a better picture of what's happening. The pain tracking lets you enter date/time, body part, the pain level, pain quality, and what may have triggered the pain. This app also tracks exercise progress both at home and exercises at PT sessions. All of this data is rendered in charts to make it easier to understand. This app also features a rep counter. This makes it easy to do complicated sets, reps, and holds for exercises. I built this tool to be useful for myself and it is :)
