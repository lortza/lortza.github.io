tagline: Your must-watch movies in one place
description: My partner and I built this app to replace the huge spreadsheet we were keeping that dated way back to 2003. Now we can track the movies we've seen, where we saw them, and what we want to see next. <br><br>We built this app in 2015 when our skills were still new, so in 2022, I did some <a href="https://github.com/mikevallano/tmdb-moviequeue/issues/270" target="_blank">significant refactoring</a> to reduce instance variables in the controllers and helper modules. And then in 2023, I added exciting new features like stats for TV shows and displaying the streaming services where content is currently available.
