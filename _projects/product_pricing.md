description: As I was comparing pricing and profit options across different manufacturing partners for a physical product I make and sell, I outgrew my spreadsheet pretty quickly. I built this app to reduce redundancy of spreadsheet cells and to offer more complex calculations for multiple options -- with all results available on one page. It's bare bones on the front end, as I put all of my attention into getting some calculations out quickly and accurately.
