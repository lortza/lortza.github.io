how remote work complicates imposter syndrome

Imposter syndrome is real for all of us and it may even be a little harder for remote folks

I work remotely. I've been working remotely in one capacity or another since 2007.

something really smart Here

Recently, I spent a week on-site in the office when the whole department got together. And even though I was struggling with a shitload of imposter syndrome... (more on that later)

Something else happened. I had spent the past seven months getting to know my coworkers via video chat and Slack messages. When you're accustomed to this sort of thing, it is easy to forget that you're only seeing a person from the top of their head to the top of their chest. When I was onsite, I got to see everybody's full bodies and wow that was something. I had not realized how many full-body mannerisms I had been missing. I saw so much insecurity. I saw nervousness. I saw people out of their comfort zones -- all while seeming completely normal in the headcam zone.  

I was surprised at how short most people were. That's right. Folks were not as tall in person as they seemed via webcams.

It was like I was meeting all of my coworkers again for the first time.  

You know, it is easy to look away from a webcam during a meeting and have that seem normal. That's not the case in person. Here we're forced to do all of the social things.

I felt really good about that. And all of those things made me see how human we all are. Seeing other people's insecurities _right there_ in their body language was huge.



some bullets instead
- how to remind yourself
- how to bridge the gap
- how to diffuse
- acknowledge that I.S. exists and call it out when you feel it
- remember everyone feels it
- go teach newer folks something. this will help you realize that you have learned a lot
- remember to look down the mountain
- make notes of the things you accomplish each day or week
- stop telling yourself you're surrounded by geniuses
- start telling yourself you're one of the geniuses you're sitting next to
