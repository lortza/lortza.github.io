title:  'How to Globally Disable ri and rdoc During Gem Installs'

Every time I install Rails, I kick myself for forgetting to add the `--no-ri` and `--no-rdoc` flags like this:

```bash
gem install rails -v 5.2.0 --no-ri --no-rdoc
```
This results in a _lot_ of documentation being installed, which takes a while. And frankly, I'm offline so rarely while working, that I really don't need access to offline documentation.

Today I decided to make this "no docs" setting global by adding `gem: --no-document` to my `.gemrc` file. Here's how.

### Open the .gemrc File

To open your `.gemrc` file in your default text editor, type this into the command line:

```bash
open ~/.gemrc
```

You'll see something like this:

```bash
---
:backtrace: false
:bulk_threshold: 1000
:sources:
- http://rubygems.org
:update_sources: true
:verbose: true
```

### Insert the Setting

Then insert `gem: --no-document` to the top of the file like this:

```bash
---
gem: --no-document
:backtrace: false
:bulk_threshold: 1000
:sources:
- http://rubygems.org
:update_sources: true
:verbose: true
```

### Save & Close

Save, close, and voila, it worked for me. My next Rails install skipped the documentation.
