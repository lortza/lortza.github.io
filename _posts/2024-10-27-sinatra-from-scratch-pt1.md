title:  How to Build a Basic Sinatra App - Part 1 Basic Setup

I've been a Rails developer for a while now so I recently built an app in Sinatra for fun. To help me with this project, I read [the Sinatra docs](https://sinatrarb.com/intro.html) and a lot of blog posts, but nothing really outlined what a basic app needed for setup. Now I'm building my second Sinatra app and I decided to capture my steps so it is easier for you (and tbh, FutureMe) to get started with a basic Sinatra app.

This post assumes a working knowledge of Ruby apps and some Rails background. Also this app does not include a database. The app I'm building is going to use Ruby hashes (all fancied up as `ActiveHash`) instead of database tables, so if you need a database in your Sinatra app, you'll need to do some googling to wire up your db.

I once had a full Rails app for yoga playlists. I learned a bunch of yoga a decade ago and naturally, I built an app for it.ðŸ˜‚ Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ It was database-backed and had all of the bells and whistles. When Heroku discontinued its free tier, I chose to kill that app. Now, several years later, I am resurrecting it as a Sinatra app, foregoing a database because Heroku charges extra for databases.ðŸ’¸ Now you know the impetus. Let's get started!

## Getting Started
Let's get started by creating the main folder for the application via the command line and `cd`ing into it:
```
mkdir yogaposeplaylist && cd "$_"
```

Create these basic files that we'll need for the app via the command line as well. We'll fill the files' contents in here shortly:
```
touch application.rb
touch config.ru
touch Gemfile
touch Procfile
touch .ruby_version
touch README.md
```

Then I like to open the whole project folder in VS Code with:
```
code .
```

But you can do whatever you want. Add the following code to each file. At the time of this post, I'm using Ruby 3.2.2, but you should use the latest version of any of Ruby and any of the gems I mention in this post:

Put this code in the `Gemfile`:
```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

ruby '3.2.2'

gem 'puma'
gem 'rake'
gem 'rackup'
gem 'sinatra'

# I also know I am going to need binding.pry
group :development do
  gem 'pry'
end
```

Put this code in the `.ruby_version` file:
```
'3.2.2'
```

Then bundle the gems by running `bundle` on the command line:
```
bundle
```
You should now see a `Gemfile.lock` file in your project directory.


Put this code in the `config.ru` file:
```ruby
require './application' # <- this is pointing to our application.rb file
run Sinatra::Application
```

Put this code in the `Procfile` -- which I needed when I deployed to Heroku, so we're just getting a head start here.
```
web: bundle exec ruby application.rb -p $PORT
```

The next file is the `application.rb` file, which is the centerpiece of our app. This is where we load all of our necessary dependencies as well as declare our routes. Since I am personally used to the way Rails splits out config from routes and other concerns, so I find this file to be kind of messy. Alas, we're here in Sinatra to see what it's like outside of the magic kingdom ðŸª„ of Rails, right? ðŸ˜‚

We'll be requiring all of the basic gems we need for the app to run. Paste this code into the `application.rb` file:
```ruby
require 'sinatra'
if settings.environment == :development
  require 'pry'
end
```
Also keep in mind: **Any time you make changes to your `application.rb` file, you need to restart the server** -- which I'll tell you how to do in a bit.

## Rendering Content
For now, let's put a basic "hello world" message on the home page. To do so, add this route with content to the `application.rb` file:

```ruby
get '/' do
  'Hello World!'
end
```


In the `README.md` file, I like to put basic instructions that will help FutureMe remember how to do basic things:
```markdown
# README
This application uses Sinatra to render yoga poses in playlists.

Run server locally with:
ruby application.rb

In the browser:
http://localhost:4567


## Resources
* Docs: https://sinatrarb.com/intro.html
* Helpers: https://www.sitepoint.com/sinatras-little-helpers/
* Extensions: https://sinatrarb.com/extensions.html
```

And now it is time to run the app! Just like the README says, on the command line, run just like you would any Ruby file:
```bash
ruby application.rb

# You can kill the server with `cmd c` when you care to.
```

Then in the browser go to: [http://localhost:4567/](http://localhost:4567/)

You should see "Hello World!" on the screen. ðŸŽ‰

And that's it! That's a basic Sinatra app. Anne out. ðŸŽ¤ðŸ’¥

If you'd like to know more, in [this next post]({% post_url 2024-10-27-sinatra-from-scratch-pt2 %}), I'm going to render some `index` and `show` pages as well as use `ActiveHash` to organize data without a database.
