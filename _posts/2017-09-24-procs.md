I've read about and practiced working with Ruby procs -- all with contrived examples. That's all well and good, but for me, the best learning comes with a heaping helping of context, which has been sorely missing from most of the contrived examples. I finally got some good context today when the need for a proc sprung up organically in a code challenge I was working on. So now I get it. I have a much stronger foothold on procs and when to use them. Hopefully seeing my process here will help build context for when you may be able to use a proc to solve a similar problem.

### The Challenge: Building a Message Cipher

Here's the challenge: I'm building a message cipher -- a small program that will encode and decode messages. When it encodes, it takes a letter argument and an offset. It adds the offset to the input letter and outputs letter corresponding to that location. For example:

#### With an offset of 0, all letters line up
```ruby
offset = 0
input = a

+0 +1 +2 +3 +4 +5 ...
 a  b  c  d  e  f ...

a + 0 = a
```

### With an offset of 3, all numbers slide down 3 places
```ruby
offset = 3
input = a

+0 +1 +2 +3 +4 +5 ...
 a  b  c  d  e  f ...

a + 3 = d
```

```ruby
offset = 3
input = c

+0 +1 +2 +3 +4 +5 ...
 c  d  e  f  g  h ...

c + 3 = f
```

### The Encoder

Here's my original `encode` method. For the sake of simplicity in explaining procs, this encoder does not handle wrapping the alphabet for letters exceeding "z".


```ruby
ALPHABET = ('a'..'z').to_a

def encode(message, offset)
  output = []
  message.chars.each do |letter|
    new_index = ALPHABET.index(letter) + offset
    output << ALPHABET[new_index]
  end

  output.join()
end
```

```ruby
# Outputting the results:

cipher = Cipher.new
p cipher.encode('ilikekitties', 3)
#> lolnhnlwwlhv
```

### The Decoder

After writing the encoder, I realized that the only difference between the process of encoding and decoding was the use of `+` or `-`. Instead of creating a nearly identical `decode` method, I decided to extract the encode/decode logic out into their own methods and leave the rest of the process in a method called `processor`.

```ruby
def processor(message, offset, adjusted_index_proc)
  output = []
  message.chars.each do |letter|
    #
    # This part will need to become generic
    # so it can both encode and decode.
    #
  end
  output.join()
end

def encode(message, offset)
  #
  # Encoding-specific code will go here,
  # then we'll call the processor method.
  #
end

def decode(message, offset)
  #
  # Decoding-specific code will go here,
  # then we'll call the processor method.
  #
end
```


Then I realized that in order for the encode/decode methods to work, they'll have to access the value of the `letter` iterator happening in the `message.chars.each do |letter|...` block inside the `processor` method. Yikes. _So how do you do that?_

*Procs! Tada! I found my own completely non-contrived use for a proc. At last.* Here's how it plays out:

### Incorporating the proc logic
I created a new proc for both the `encode` and `decode` methods:

```ruby
def encode(message, offset)
  proc = Proc.new #...
  processor(message, offset, proc)
end

def decode(message, offset)
  proc = Proc.new #...
  processor(message, offset, proc)
end
```

And then passed the proc into the `processor` method as an argument.

```ruby
def processor(message, offset, adjusted_index_proc)
  # ...
end
```

I needed the proc inside the `each` loop to:
  1. take the value of the current message input letter
  2. get the index of where it is stored in the `ALPHABET` array
  3. add the offset value (3) to that index
  4. return the new index number for the encoded letter
So the `encode` and `decode` methods with their procs look like this:

```ruby
def encode(message, offset)
  proc = Proc.new { |letter| ALPHABET.index(letter) + offset }
  processor(message, offset, proc)
end

def decode(message, offset)
  proc = Proc.new { |letter| ALPHABET.index(letter) - offset }
  processor(message, offset, proc)
end
```

The new `processor` method takes the proc and `.call()`s it along with a `letter` argument for each letter of the input message inside the `each` loop. That new index is then used to get the value of the new letter from the `ALPHABET` array and then the new letter is pushed into the `output` array.

```ruby
def processor(message, offset, adjusted_index_proc)
  output = []
  message.chars.each do |letter|
    new_index = adjusted_index_proc.call(letter)
    output << ALPHABET[new_index]
  end
  # ...
end
```

Lastly, the output array is joined back into a string and we get our encoded/decoded message.

```ruby
def processor(message, offset, adjusted_index_proc)
  #...
  output.join()
end
```

### Outputting the Results

```ruby
# Outputting the results

cipher = Cipher.new

p cipher.encode('ilikekitties', 3)
#> lolnhnlwwlhv

p cipher.decode('lolnhnlwwlhv', 3)
#> ilikekitties
```

### Putting it all Together
```ruby

class Cipher

  ALPHABET = ('a'..'z').to_a

  def processor(message, offset, adjusted_index_proc)
    output = []
    message.chars.each do |letter|
      new_index = adjusted_index_proc.call(letter)
      output << ALPHABET[new_index]
    end
    output.join()
  end

  def encode(message, offset)
    proc = Proc.new { |letter| ALPHABET.index(letter) + offset }
    processor(message, offset, proc)
  end

  def decode(message, offset)
    proc = Proc.new { |letter| ALPHABET.index(letter) - offset }
    processor(message, offset, proc)
  end
end

cipher = Cipher.new

p cipher.encode('ilikekitties', 3)
#> lolnhnlwwlhv

p cipher.decode('lolnhnlwwlhv', 3)
#> ilikekitties

```


Though this is not the most streamlined or elegant cipher code base, it has been useful to me in building my understanding of procs. I hope it's been useful to you too!
