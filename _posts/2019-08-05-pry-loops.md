Ever been caught in a loop while `binding.pry`ing through a spec in RSpec? I have to admit I put myself in that situation far too many times before I learned how to get out of it properly. As it turns out it's really easy to exit a loop in `pry`... and without shutting down the Rails server.

```
exit!
```

If that syntax doesn't suit your fancy, there are [more ways to exit a loop in `pry`](https://github.com/pry/pry/wiki/State-navigation#exit-the-program-completely), such as:

```
!!!
```
and
```
exit-program
```
