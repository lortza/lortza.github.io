A while back, I set up a bookmark folder in my browser with all of the default localhost addresses I use. It's come in pretty handy as I switch between projects, so I figured I'd share that list of urls all in once place in case you'd like to do the same.

{% highlight text %}
  localhosts
   - rails
     http://localhost:3000/
   - sinatra
     http://localhost:4567/
   - jekyll
     http://localhost:4000/
   - mailcatcher
     http://localhost:1080/
   - elasticsearch
     http://localhost:9200/
{% endhighlight %}


For those of you who live in Rails, some handy Rails urls:
{% highlight text %}
  Rails
   - localhost
     http://localhost:3000/
   - Rake Routes
     http://localhost:3000/rails/info/routes
   - Rails Routes
     http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html
{% endhighlight %}
