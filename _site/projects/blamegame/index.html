  <p>In March 2020 when COVID-19 forced us all into quarantine, I wanted to still be able to play some of my favorite in-person games with friends and family. I had a copy of The Voting Game and decided to make a private online version of it. I took this opportunity to play with Rails' ActionCable so that all players' screens would be up to date with the phases of the game. <br><br>The mechanics of the game are simple. All players are presented with a question like 'Who is most likely to lie to their doctor?' and each player votes for the player they think best matches. Votes are tallied across rounds and a 'winner' is declared at the end of a set of X questions. The person setting up the game can determine the number of questions per round and also has the ability to create and solicit custom questions for the game. It's great for customizing decks for different groups of people -- a bunch of software engineer coworkers will see different questions than a pile of family members.</p>
