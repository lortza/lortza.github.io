  <h2>Rails Projects</h2>

  <p class="section-explanation">Oh man. Writing web apps is so much fun. There is so much you can do and so many people available to do it along with you. These are some of the apps I've made. Of course, looking back at the code now, there is so much to be improved. I just keep marching forward onto new challenges. This week's challenge: learn jekyll and customize a theme. If you're seeing this page, then my efforts have led to a successful deployment :)</p>

<h2>Published Works</h2>

<p class="section-explanation">Whenever I have an idea for something that solves a particular problem, I jump right in and make it. Sometimes it's a solution I can use right now (zipper pocket underpants) and other times, it's a solution that I wish had existed when I needed it (book on packing), so I created it to solve the problem for other people.</p>

        <p>I was curious to read tarot cards, but it was lots to memorize up front just to do a reading. I made this deck and spreads to be self-reading. All you have to do is lay down the cards and read what's on them. So much fun at parties! <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/488215794/new-orleans-pocket-tarot-deck" target="_blank" alt="Etsy">See it on Etsy</a></p>

        <p>Coloring is fun. And some adult coloring books take themselves way too seriously with intense patterns and lots of decisions to make. I created this book to be as simple and playful as children's books, but with scenes from adult life. <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Adventures-Adulting-Adult-Coloring-Book/dp/1544191367" target="_blank" alt="Amazon">See it on Amazon</a></p>

    <p><p>While we were traveling, my husband and I were seeing a lot of ecological and human problems that we hadn't seen first hand before. We were also seeing people who were working to solve these problems. It was really inspiring, so we started a separate blog to have a reason to connect with these people and write about their efforts. (We recently rolled that content into our main travel blog.) In December of 2016, a person producing sustainable dental floss contacted me regarding <a href="http://viajaryamar.com/2013/11/13/floss/" target="_blank">a post I wrote on dental floss waste and sustainable alternatives</a> asking me for permission to print a quote from my post on her packaging. How cool is that?</p>
