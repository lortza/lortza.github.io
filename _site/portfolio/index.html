<h2>Published Works</h2>

<p class="section-explanation">Whenever I have an idea for something that solves a particular problem, I jump right in and make it. Sometimes it's a solution I can use right now (zipper pocket underpants) and other times, it's a solution that I wish had existed when I needed it (book on packing), so I created it to solve the problem for other people.</p>

        <p>I was curious to read tarot cards, but it was a lot to memorize up front in order to do a reading. I made this deck and spreads to be self-reading. All you have to do is lay down the cards and read what's on them. It fixed the glitch for me and they're selling like hotcakes on Etsy. <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/488215794" target="_blank" alt="Etsy">See it on Etsy</a></p>

        <p>Coloring is fun. But for me, some of those adult coloring books with intense patterns and endless decisions to make feel more like a chore than play. I created this book to be as simple to color and as playful as children's books, but with snarky scenes of chores and woes from adult life. <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Adventures-Adulting-Adult-Coloring-Book/dp/1544191367" target="_blank" alt="Amazon">See it on Amazon</a></p>

    <h4><a href="http://viajaryamar.com/category/shiftedperspective">Sustainability Blog</a></h4>
    <p><p>While we were traveling, my husband and I were seeing a lot of ecological and human problems that we hadn't seen first hand before. We were also seeing people who were working to solve these problems. It was really inspiring, so we started a separate blog to have a reason to connect with these people and write about their efforts. (We recently rolled that content into our main travel blog.) In December of 2016, a person producing sustainable dental floss contacted me regarding <a href="http://viajaryamar.com/2013/11/13/floss/" target="_blank">a post I wrote on dental floss waste and sustainable alternatives</a> asking me for permission to print a quote from my post on her packaging. How cool is that?</p>
