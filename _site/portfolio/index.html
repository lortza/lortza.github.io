  <h2>Web Applications</h2>

  <p class="section-explanation">I am almost always engrossed in building a tool that solves a problem for myself. These projects are some of those tools that I have built.

  <h2>Published Works</h2>

  <p class="section-explanation">Whenever I have an idea for something that solves a particular problem, I dive in and start creating. Sometimes it's a solution I can use right now (zipper pocket underpants) and other times, it's a solution that I wish had existed when I needed it (book on packing), so I created it to solve the problem for other people.</p>

            <p>I was curious to read tarot cards, but it was a lot to memorize up front in order to do a reading. I made this deck and spreads to be self-reading. All you have to do is lay down the cards and read what's on them.

            <p>Coloring is fun. But for me, some of those adult coloring books with intense patterns and endless decisions to make feel more like a chore than play.

          <p>After being inspired by all of the things people are making and sharing via Instructables, I was excited to participate in the community. I wrote three instructables to show people how to make the things I just made: <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Ladies-Zipper-Pocket-Underpants/" target="_blank" alt="instructable">zipper pocket underwear</a> (<a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Zipper-Pocket-Underpants-With-Bottom-Loading-Zippe/" target="_blank" alt="instructable">twice</a>, actually), <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Wooden-Air-Plant-Necklace/" target="_blank" alt="instructable">plant necklaces</a>, and how to <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Convert-Poker-Cards-to-Tarot-Cards/" target="_blank" alt="instructable">convert a poker deck into a tarot deck</a>.</p>

          <h4><a href="http://viajaryamar.com">Travel Blog</a></h4>
          <p>As we lived and worked (remotely) in several Latin American countries, we documented some of the highlights and adventures we had. I also wrote some posts on logistics to help other would-be travelers to take the plunge.</p>

          <h4><a href="http://viajaryamar.com/category/shiftedperspective">Sustainability Blog</a></h4>
          <p>While we were traveling, my husband and I were seeing a lot of ecological and human problems that we hadn’t seen first hand before. We were also seeing people who were working to solve these problems. It was really inspiring, so we started a separate blog to have a reason to connect with these people and write about their efforts. (We recently rolled that content into our main travel blog.) In December of 2016, a person producing sustainable dental floss contacted me regarding <a href="http://viajaryamar.com/2013/11/13/floss/" target="_blank">a post I wrote on dental floss waste and sustainable alternatives</a> asking me for permission to print a quote from my post on her packaging. How cool is that?</p>
