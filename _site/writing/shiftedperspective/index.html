  <article class="post-content">
    <p>While we were traveling, my husband and I were seeing a lot of ecological and human problems that we hadnâ€™t seen first hand before. We were also seeing people who were working to solve these problems. It was really inspiring, so we started a separate blog to have a reason to connect with these people and write about their efforts. (We recently rolled that content into our main travel blog.) In December of 2016, a person producing sustainable dental floss contacted me regarding <a href="http://viajaryamar.com/2013/11/13/floss/" target="_blank">a post I wrote on dental floss waste and sustainable alternatives</a> asking me for permission to print a quote from my post on her packaging. How cool is that?</p>
