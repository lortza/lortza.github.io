<p>I’ve taken a lot of courses over the past few years as I’ve worked my way into the software engineering world. Some learning materials are a lot better than others. Though most importantly, I’ve found that the best material is the material that I need <em>right now</em>. For example, there may be a brilliant course on Node.js, but if I haven’t grasped the basics of Javascript, that’s not a good course <em>for me</em>, <em>right now</em>.</p>

<p>All of that said, this is a list of some of my favorite materials and why I loved them. And while the languages/frameworks appear in no particular order, the items within those languages/frameworks are in order from least-to-most complex.</p>

<h2 id="if-youre-starting-from-scratch">If You’re Starting From Scratch</h2>
<p>Yay! How exciting! There are so many ways to start. I recommend starting with the one thing that excites you the most and staying focused on that until you understand it well enough to move on. These are some of my favorite resources for beginners. I started with Ruby, so you’ll see most of my resources are Ruby-centric.</p>

<h3 id="html-css-and-ruby--by-railsbridge"><a href="http://curriculum.railsbridge.org/docs/">HTML, CSS, and Ruby</a> – by RailsBridge</h3>
<p>Format: tutorial documents<br />
RailsBridge is an organization that pushes for all kinds of diversity in tech: gender, race, sexual orientation, ability, and class. They’ve built a nice curriculum and hold workshops to help you get started. I’m directing you to these two parts of their curriculum just to get you pointed in a direction. Follow the links on the left side of these pages to get through all of the content.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If making webpages look good excites you, <a href="http://curriculum.railsbridge.org/frontend/">start with HTML and CSS</a>.</li>
  <li>If you’re excited about building the code that powers the site, <a href="http://curriculum.railsbridge.org/learn-to-code/learn-to-code">start with ruby</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="try-ruby"><a href="https://try.ruby-lang.org/">Try Ruby</a></h3>
<p>Format: short course<br />
Start tinkering with Ruby right away in the browser. No need to set up your computer to do anything fancy for you. Just start to get a feel of how to do some basic exercises in Ruby.</p>

<h3 id="learn-ruby--on-codeacademy"><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby#">Learn Ruby</a> – on CodeAcademy</h3>
<p>Format: course<br />
CodeAcademy steps you through the basics of programming in Ruby. This course focuses on data types (like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">string</code> vs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">array</code>) and how those pieces interact with each other to make meaningful code.</p>

<h3 id="get-connected--with-and-for-women-who-code"><a href="https://www.womenwhocode.com/networks">Get Connected</a> – with and for Women Who Code</h3>
<p>Format: organization<br />
Women Who Code’s mission is to inspire women to excel in technology careers. If you identify as female, connect to <a href="https://www.womenwhocode.com/networks">your local chapter</a> and get yourself a group of peers. I’ve enjoyed a lot of support and camaraderie from my time spent with this group. Also, look for <a href="https://www.meetup.com/">a local meetup</a> about coding. You’ll find that lots of folks would love to help you. I love my people at my local Austin <a href="https://www.meetup.com/austinrb/">Ruby</a>,  <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Austin-on-Rails">Rails</a>, and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Austin/events/ntdlsrybcjbvb/">Ruby Tuesday</a> meetups.</p>

<h2 id="rails">Rails</h2>
<h3 id="rails-i--rails-ii--by-mike--nicole-of-pragmatic-studio"><a href="https://pragmaticstudio.com/courses/rails">Rails I</a> &amp; <a href="https://pragmaticstudio.com/courses/rails-ii">Rails II</a> – by Mike &amp; Nicole of Pragmatic Studio</h3>
<p>Format: course <br />
I came to these courses after completing a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants 8-week full-stack web development bootcamp. I was a n00b and quite green in my skills. These courses were excellent for me because they broke down the common processes in Rails into easy-to-understand pieces. They also brought home the learning with repetition of doing the videos, doing the homework, and doing the bonus work. Plus, they have a TDD option. They’re great foundational courses and I can’t recommend them enough for beginners to web development.</p>

<h2 id="javascript">Javascript</h2>
<h3 id="javascript-and-the-dom--on-udacity"><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-and-the-dom--ud117">Javascript and the DOM</a> – on Udacity</h3>
<p>Format: course <br />
This course is great if you’re about to embark on learning front end engineering and don’t know anything about selecting elements or extracting values from DOM elements. It uses plain old Javascript selectors and really doubles down on teaching the basics of DOM anatomy. Take this <em>before</em> jumping into any front end framework like React.</p>

<h3 id="modern-javascript-from-the-beginning--on-udemy-by-brad-traversy"><a href="https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/">Modern JavaScript From The Beginning</a> – on Udemy, by Brad Traversy</h3>
<p>Format: course <br />
You want to learn Javascript? This is my favorite course. The instructor is thorough and engaging (which is a tough balance to strike). He covers older JS syntax and ES6, all while explaining how the language works and what you can do with it. I give this course so much credit for leveling-up my Javascript skills.</p>

<h3 id="js-design-patterns--on-udacity"><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-design-patterns--ud989">JS Design Patterns</a> – on Udacity</h3>
<p>Format: course <br />
This course is not as thorough as <a href="https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/">Modern JavaScript From The Beginning</a> is, but it is a nice follow-up that focuses specifically on design patterns. If you’re past the basic “how do I make the javascripts” phase, <em>get better at it</em> with this course.</p>

<h2 id="react">React</h2>
<h3 id="react-for-beginners--by-wes-bos"><a href="https://reactforbeginners.com/">React for Beginners</a> – by Wes Bos</h3>
<p>Format: course <br />
I love love love this course. To be honest, I just kind of love Wes Bos, and this course is responsible for my wesboslove. React is a chaotic place for me. Information is stored in so many places and flows around like crazy. Witnessing Wes Bos handle this crazy topic is like watching an Olympic skater land a triple toe loop and make it look effortless. He’s engaging, playful, and knows his stuff. If you already generally know how web development works and know some Javascript, this course will take you from “I’ve heard of React” to “I can work my way through an existing codebase and create some new components.”</p>

<h3 id="the-free-react-on-rails-5-course--on-learnetto-by-hrishi-mittal"><a href="https://learnetto.com/users/hrishio/courses/the-free-react-on-rails-5-course">The Free React on Rails 5 course</a> – on Learnetto, by Hrishi Mittal</h3>
<p>Format: course <br />
This is a great free course to get you started on React with Rails. I had a few bumps along the way with some things not working as expected, but considering that the course is <em>free</em> and otherwise excellent in content, it doesn’t concern me. I work primarily in Rails, so after taking the Wes Bos course above, I liked taking this one to put it in the context of Rails. Also, Hrishi’s a really nice person. He’s working hard to build useful tools for devs. Go say hello to him when you have the chance.</p>

<h3 id="simple-rails-crud-app-with-react-frontend-using-react-rails-gem--on-medium-by-lucya-koroleva"><a href="https://medium.com/quick-code/simple-rails-crud-app-with-react-frontend-using-react-rails-gem-b708b89a9419">Simple Rails CRUD app with React Frontend, using ‘react-rails’ gem</a> – on Medium, by Lucya Koroleva</h3>
<p>Format: blog post <br />
There are a couple of ways to implement React with Rails. This post does an excellent job of walking you though how to do it with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">react-rails</code> gem. If you have a grip on the basics of Rails and React, this is a nice capstone to give yourself some perspective on the gem implementation.</p>

<h2 id="vue">Vue</h2>
<h3 id="vue-cli--by-mike--nicole-of-pragmatic-studio"><a href="https://pragmaticstudio.com/tutorials/vue-cli">Vue CLI</a> – by Mike &amp; Nicole of Pragmatic Studio</h3>
<p>Format: course <br />
This is great for dipping your toe into Vue before doing further reading or courses. It’s a nice overview where you get to see some basic components take shape. It won’t take you from 0 to expert – not by a long shot. But it will take you from “I know kind of how React works” to “ah, Vue is a lot like React but has some subtle differences”.</p>

<h3 id="a-single-page-app-with-vuejs-and-rails--by-mike--nicole-of-pragmatic-studio"><a href="https://pragmaticstudio.com/courses/unpacked-single-page-app-with-vue-rails">A Single-Page App with Vue.js and Rails</a> – by Mike &amp; Nicole of Pragmatic Studio</h3>
<p>Format: course <br />
This course is fast-paced and designed for people who 1) already know how Rails works and 2) have a concept of how a front-end framework works. In the course, they weave together a Vue front end with a Rails API, walking us through how the pieces all talk to each other. I picked up this course since I just started working in Vue at work and it has paid off immediately.</p>

<h2 id="sql">SQL</h2>
<h3 id="sqlbolt"><a href="https://sqlbolt.com/">SQLBolt</a></h3>
<p>Format: tutorial <br />
Lots of great SQL examples and exercises here. If you’re working in Rails’ Active Record and think you don’t need to know straight SQL, think again. Getting your SQL basics (and not-so-basics) will make you a better designer and make your queries less expensive.</p>

<h3 id="modes-sql-tutorial"><a href="https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/">Mode’s Sql Tutorial</a></h3>
<p>Format: tutorial <br />
Lots of great stuff here, complete with explanations and access to a database to practice your queries.</p>

<h3 id="sqlzoo"><a href="https://sqlzoo.net/">SQLZoo</a></h3>
<p>More SQL exercises</p>

<h2 id="ruby">Ruby</h2>
<h3 id="codequizzes--by-matthew-powers"><a href="https://www.codequizzes.com/ruby">CodeQuizzes</a> – by <a href="https://github.com/MrPowers/code_quizzer">Matthew Powers</a></h3>
<p>Format: online worksheets<br />
This is, hands-down, my favorite resource for beginner Ruby. It takes you step-by-step through the basics you need to understand Ruby and gives you a lot of reps as you practice. If you need to get strong in arrays, hashes, and basic OOP, this site just may be your best friend.</p>

<hr />

<p>The rest of the resources in this section are better for people who have moved out of the total beginner phase and are seeking a deeper understanding of Ruby.</p>

<h3 id="nothing-is-something--by-sandi-metz"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29MAL8pJImQ">Nothing is Something</a> – by <a href="https://github.com/skmetz">Sandi Metz</a></h3>
<p>Format: tech talk <br />
I watched this talk after about 2 years of working in Ruby. At the time, I had been going back to my old apps and refactoring them with Rubocop suggestions. I bumped into a problem where Rubocop was complaining about some syntax which ultimately illuminated a design problem. This talk was my first foray into design patterns and I revisit it frequently to remind myself about seeing problems in a different way.</p>

<h3 id="practical-object-oriented-design-in-ruby--by-sandi-metz"><em><a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780321721334">Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby</a></em> – by <a href="https://github.com/skmetz">Sandi Metz</a></h3>
<p>Format: book <br />
I read this book after working in Ruby for a year. It was challenging at points, but overall I felt like it boosted my understanding of Ruby and object composition 100-fold. The content was very accessible to me and I recommend it to anyone who wants to get a better idea of how to write Ruby in an intentional way.</p>

<h3 id="design-patterns-in-ruby--by-russ-olsen"><em><a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780321490452">Design Patterns in Ruby</a></em> – by Russ Olsen</h3>
<p>Format: book <br />
I came to this books after about 3 years of working in Ruby. I just started (and haven’t finished) it yet, but yowza, so far so good. I’ve already picked up some new ideas on how to build cleaner apps. <em>(Shout out to Ariel V and Erica L for the recommendation)</em></p>

<h3 id="confident-ruby--by-avdi-grimm"><em><a href="https://www.confidentruby.com/">Confident Ruby</a></em> – by <a href="https://github.com/avdi">Avdi Grimm</a></h3>
<p>Format: book <br />
Similar to the one above, I came to this books after about 3 years of working in Ruby, and I just started (haven’t finished) reading it yet, but so far the ideas are really inspiring. <em>(Shout out to <a href="https://github.com/LeslieKornes">Leslie K</a> for the recommendation)</em></p>

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<h3 id="intro-to-rails-testing--by-scott-maslar"><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/395392522">Intro to Rails Testing</a> – by <a href="https://github.com/mascott">Scott Maslar</a></h3>
<p>Format: tech talk <br />
When I first started learning about testing, I didn’t really get it. It seemed redundant and weird. I wish I had heard this talk back then. I really like how Scott gives examples of each type of test and explains what the goal of the test is and what tools we can use to accomplish it.</p>
