After being inspired by all of the things people are making and sharing via Instructables, I was excited to participate in the community. I wrote three instructables to show people how to make the things I just made: <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Ladies-Zipper-Pocket-Underpants/" target="_blank" alt="instructable">zipper pocket underwear</a> (<a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Zipper-Pocket-Underpants-With-Bottom-Loading-Zippe/" target="_blank" alt="instructable">twice</a>, actually), <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Wooden-Air-Plant-Necklace/" target="_blank" alt="instructable">plant necklaces</a>, and how to <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Convert-Poker-Cards-to-Tarot-Cards/" target="_blank" alt="instructable">convert a poker deck into a tarot deck</a>.
